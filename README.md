`fontpreview` is a commandline tool that lets you **quickly search** for fonts
that are installed on your machine and preview them. The **fuzzy search** feature
is provided by `fzf` and the preview is generated with `imagemagick` and then
displayed using `sxiv`. This tool is **highly customizable**, almost all of the
variables in this tool can be changed using the commandline flags or you can 
configure them using environment variables.

A personal fork.
